# fake-news-detection
This project is a Fake News Detection System that uses Machine Learning to classify news articles as Real or Fake.

Collected and used a dataset kaggle.

Preprocessed text data using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Trained a Logistic Regression model in Google Colab.

Achieved an accuracy of around 84%.

Saved the trained model and vectorizer using Joblib.

Tested the model with custom news headlines for prediction.

Tools & libraries

Python

pandas, numpy (data handling)

scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, metrics)

joblib (saving/loading model)

Google Colab (for coding & training)

Results

Accuracy: ~84%
output:Real news
